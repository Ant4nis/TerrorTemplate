  Description: This first volume introduces readers to the practices where celestial
    bodies not only influence human fates but are gateways to realms of cosmic horror
    and ancient wisdom. With a dark approach, the book explores how the alignment
    of fictional planets and stars can trigger supernatural events and alter known
    reality. Essential for those seeking to understand the hidden forces governing
    a cosmos of unfathomable mystery.
